[>14] MM.END
If a subroutine named MM.END exists in the program it will be executed whenever the program ends with an actual or implied END command. 
It is not executed if the program ends with a Ctrl-C. 
The optional parameter 'noend' to the END command can be used to block execution of the MM.END subroutine if needed (see the END command for more information).
