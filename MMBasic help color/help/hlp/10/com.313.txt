NOT HDMI AND VGA VERSIONS
[>314] FRAMEBUFFER COPY from, to [,b] NOT HDMI AND VGA VERSIONS
Does a highly optimised full screen copy of one framebuffer to another. "from" and "to" can be N, F, or L where N is the physical display. You can 
only copy from N on displays that support BLIT and transparent text. 
The firmware will automatically compress or expand the RGB resolution when copying to and from unmatched framebuffers.
Of course copying from RGB565 to RGB121 loses information but for many applications (eg, games) 16 colour levels is more than enough. 
When copying to an LCD display the optional parameter "b" can be used (FRAMEBUFFER COPY F/L, N, B). 
This instructs the firmware to action the copy using the second CPU in the Raspberry Pi Pico and control returns immediately to the Basic program
