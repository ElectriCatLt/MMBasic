[>316] FRAMEBUFFER MERGE [colour] [,mode] [,updaterate] NOT HDMI AND VGA VERSIONS
Copies the contents of the Layer buffer and Framebuffer onto the LCD display omitting all pixels of a particular colour. Preconditions for the command 
are that FRAMEBUFFER and LAYERBUFFER are both created FRAMEBUFFER MERGE - writes the contents of the framebuffer to the physical display 
overwriting any pixels in the framebuffer that are set in the layerbuffer (not zero) 
FRAMEBUFER MERGE col - writes the contents of the framebuffer to the physical display overwriting any pixels in the framebuffer that are 
in the layerbuffer not set to the transparent colour "col". 
The colour is specified as a number between 0 and 15 representing: 
<CGRE>
0:BLACK, 1:BLUE, 2:MYRTLE, 3:COBALT, 4:MIDGREEN, 5:CERULEAN, 6: GREEN, 7:CYAN, 8:RED, 9:MAGENTA, 10:RUST, 11:FUCHSIA, 12:BROWN, 13:LILAC, 14:YELLOW, 15:WHITE
</CGRE>

FRAMEBUFFER MERGE col,B - as above except that the transfer to the physical display takes place on the second CPU and control returns to Basic 
immediately FRAMEBUFFER MERGE col,R [,updaterate] - sets the second CPU to continuously update the physical display with the merger of the two buffers.  
Automatically sets FRAMEBUFFER WRITE F if not F or L already set. By default the screen will update as fast as possible (At 133MHz an ILI9341 in
SPI mode updates about 13 times a second, in 8-bit parallel mode the ILI9341 achieves 27 FPS) If "updaterate" is set then the screen will update to 
the rate specified in milliseconds (unless that is less than the fastest achievable on the display) 
<CRED>
NB: FRAMEBUFFER WRITE cannot be set to N while continuous merged update is active. FRAMEBUFFER MERGE col,A - aborts the continuous updates 
In addition deleting either the layerbuf or framebuffer, ctrl-C, or END will abort the automatic update as well.
