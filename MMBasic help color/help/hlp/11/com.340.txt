[>341] I2C OPEN speed, timeout 
Enables the first I2C module in master mode. 
'speed' is the clock speed (in KHz) to use and must be one of 100, 400 or 1000. 
'timeout' is a value in milliseconds after which the master send and receive commands will be interrupted if they have not completed. 
The minimum value is 100. A value of zero will disable the timeout (though this is not recommended).
