[>337] GUI RESET LCDPANEL 
Will reinitialise the configured LCD panel. Initialisation is automatically done when the PicoMite firmware starts up but in some circumstances it may be necessary 
to interrupt power to the LCD panel (eg, to save battery power) and this command can then be used to reinitialise the display.
