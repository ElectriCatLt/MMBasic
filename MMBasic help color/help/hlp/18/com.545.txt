[>546] SAVE CONTEXT [CLEAR] or LOAD CONTEXT [KEEP]
<CODE>
SAVE CONTEXT [CLEAR]
</CODE>

Saves the variable space and optionally clears it. Command should be used in top level program and not from within a subroutine (may work OK but not tested for side-effects). 
Note:
<CGRE>
If used in a subroutine a subsequent LOAD CONTEXT must DEFINITELY be in the same subroutine or a crash/corruption will DEFINITELY happen.
</CGRE>
<CODE>
LOAD CONTEXT [KEEP]
</CODE>

Restores the variable space to the previously saved state and optionally preserves the stored variables to allow a second LOAD if required.
