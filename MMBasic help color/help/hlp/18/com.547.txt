ALL VERSIONS
[>548] SAVE IMAGE file$ [,x, y, w, h]  or  SAVE COMPRESSED IMAGE file$ [,x, y, w, h] 
Save the current image on the video output or LCD panel as a BMP file. 
Any LCD panel must be capable of being read, for example, a ILI9341 based panel or a VIRTUAL_M or VIRTUAL_C panel. 
'file$' is the name of the file. If an extension is not specified ".BMP" will be added to the file name. 
The image is saved as a true colour 24-bit image. 
'x', 'y', 'w' and 'h' are optional and are the coordinates ('x' and 'y' are the top left coordinate) and  dimensions (width and height) of the area to be saved. 
If not specified the whole screen will be saved. 
SAVE COMPRESSED IMAGE will work the same except that RLE compression will be used to reduce the file size.
