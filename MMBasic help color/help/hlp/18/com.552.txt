ALL VERSIONS
[>553] SETPIN pin, cfg, target [, option]
Will configure 'pin' to generate an interrupt according to 'cfg'. 
Any I/O pin capable of digital input can be  configured to generate an interrupt with a maximum of ten interrupts configured at any one time. 
'cfg' is a keyword and can be any one of the following:
OFF Not configured or inactive
INTH Interrupt on low to high input
INTL Interrupt on high to low input
INTB Interrupt on both (i.e. any change to the input) 
'target' is a user defined subroutine which will be called when  the event happens. Return from the interrupt is via the END SUB or EXIT SUB commands. 
'option' is the same as used in SETPIN pin DIN (above). 
This mode also configures the pin as a digital input so the value of the pin can always be retrieved using the function PIN(). 
Refer to the chapter Using the I/O pins for a general description.
