[>511] PLAY MIDIFILE file$ [,interrupt] (VS1053 specific)
Will play a MIDI file on the sound output. 'file$' is the MIDI file to play (the extension of .mid will be appended if missing). 
The MIDI file is played in the background. 
'interrupt' is optional and is the name of a subroutine which will be called when the file has finished playing. 
If file$ is a directory the Pico will play all of the files in that directory in turn.
