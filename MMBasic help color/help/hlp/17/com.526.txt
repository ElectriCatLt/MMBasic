ALL VERSIONS
[>527] PULSE pin, width 
Will generate a pulse on 'pin' with duration of 'width' ms. 'width' can be a fraction. 
For example, 0.01 is equal to 10us and this enables the generation of very narrow pulses. 
The minimum is 5 us at 40 MHz to 40 us at 5 MHz. 
The generated pulse is of the opposite polarity to the state of the I/O pin when the command is executed. 
For example, if the output is set high the PULSE command will generate a negative going pulse. 
Notes: 
<CGRE>
-'pin' must be configured as an output. 
- For a pulse of less than 3 ms the accuracy is ± 1 us. 
- For a pulse of 3 ms or more the accuracy is ± 0.5 ms.  
A pulse of 3 ms or more will run in the background. 
Up to five different and concurrent pulses can be running in the background and each can have its time changed by issuing a new PULSE command or it can be terminated by issuing a PULSE command with zero for 'width'.
