[>529] PWM SYNC s0 [,s1][,s2][,s3][,s4][,s5][,s6][,s7]
This initiates the PWM on channels where a deferred start was defined or just syncs existing running channels. 
However, the power comes in the ability to offset the channels one to another (defined as a percentage of the time period as per the duty cycle - can be a float) 
You can use an offset of -1 to omit a channel from the synch
