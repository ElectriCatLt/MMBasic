ALL VERSIONS
[>534] READ variable[, variable]... 
Reads values from DATA statements and assigns these values to the named variables. 
Variable types in a READ statement must match the data types in DATA statements as they are read. 
Arrays can be used as variables (specified with empty brackets, e.g. a()) and in that case the size of the array is used to determine how many elements are to be read. 
If the array is multidimensional then the leftmost dimension will be the fastest moving. See also DATA  and RESTORE.
