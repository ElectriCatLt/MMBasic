[>726] MATH(BASE64 ENCODE/DECODE in$/in(), out$/out())
Returns the length of out$/out(). This base64 encodes or decodes the data in 'in' and puts the result in 'out'. 
Where arrays are used as the output they must be big enough relative to the input and the direction. 
Encryption increases length by 4/3 and decryption decreases it by 3/4.
