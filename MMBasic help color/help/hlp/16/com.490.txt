ALL VERSIONS
[>491] PIXEL x, y [,c] 
Set a pixel on the VGA screen to a colour. 
'x' is the horizontal coordinate and 'y' is the vertical coordinate of the pixel.
'c' is a 24 bit number specifying the colour. 
'c' is optional and if omitted the current foreground colour will be used.
All parameters can be expressed as arrays and the software will plot the number of pixels as determined by the dimensions of  the smallest array.
'x' and 'y' must both be arrays or both be single variables /constants otherwise an error will be generated.
'c' can be either an array or a  single variable or constant.
See the section Graphics Commands and Functions for a definition of the colours and graphics coordinates.
