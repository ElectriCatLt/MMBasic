[>508] PLAY MP3 file$ [, interrupt] (VS1053 specific)
Will play a MP3 file on the sound output. 
'file$' is the MP3 file to play (the extension of .mp3 will be appended if missing). 
The sample rate should be 44100Hz stereo. The MP3 file is played in the background. 
'interrupt' is optional and is the name of a subroutine which will be called when the file has finished playing. 
If file$ is a directory the Pico will play all of the files in that directory in turn.
