[>223] CAMERA REGISTER reg%, data%
Sets the register "reg%" in the camera to the value "data%". 
When used the command will report to the console the previous value and automatically confirms that the new value has been set as requested. 
The colour rendition of the camera as initialised is reasonable but could probably be improved further by tuning the various camera registers.
