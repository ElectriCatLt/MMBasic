[>218] CAMERA OPEN XLKpin, PLKpin, HSpin, VSCpin, RETpin, D0pin
This initialises the camera, It outputs a 12MHz clock on XLK (PWM) and checks that it is correctly receiving  signals on PLK, VS, and HS. The camera 
is set to a resolution of 160x120 (QQVGA) which is the maximum achievable 
within the limits of the available memory. Enable OPTION SYSTEM I2C in the PicoMite firmware and wire SCL and SDA to the relevant pins (may be labelled SIOC and SIOD on the camera module). 
These connections must have a pullup to 3.3V - 2K7 recommended) Other pins are wired as per the OPEN command.

(NB: VS may be labelled VSYNC, HS may be labelled HREF, PLK may be labelled PCLK, RET may be labelled RESET and XLK may be XCLK on your module) D0pin defines the start of a range of 8 contiguous pins (eg,GP0 - GP7).
