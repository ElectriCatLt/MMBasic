[>212] BLIT MEMORY address, x, y [,col]
Copies an area of memory treated as a packed array of colour nibbles to the current graphical output as specified by FRAMEBUFFER WRITE. The colour is 
specified as a number between 0 and 15 representing: 
<CGRE>
Black, Blue, Myrtle, Cobalt, Midgreen, Cerulean, green, cyan, red, magenta, rust, fuschia, brown, lilac, yellow and white 
</CGRE>

The first word of the area of memory starting at 'address%' must contain the width and height of the area to be copied as 
16-bit integers with the width as the bottom 16 bits. The address must be aligned to a word boundary (divisible
by 4). If the optional parameter 'col' is specified then that specific colour is not copied. If the top bit of either the width or height is set to 1 
then the colour data is treated as compressed (the remaining 15 bits are used 
as the width and/or height). The compression algorithm is simple, each byte contains a count in the bottom nibble (1-15) and a colour in the top 
nibble (0-15). In the event that more than 15 pixels are the same colour additional bytes are used for that colour.
