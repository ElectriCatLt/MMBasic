This will define an embedded font which can be used alongside or to replace  the built in font(s) used on the VGA output. 
These work exactly same as the built in fonts (i.e. selected using the FONT command or specified in the TEXT command).
See the Embedded Fonts folder in the PicoMiteVGA distribution zip file for a selection of embedded fonts and a full description of how to create them. 
'#Nbr' is the font's reference number (from 1 to 16). It can be the same number as a built in font and in that case it will replace the built in font. 
Each 'hex' must be exactly eight hex digits and beseparated by spaces or new lines from the next.  
<CGRE>
- Multiple lines of 'hex' words can be used with the command terminated by a matching END DEFINEFONT.  
-Multiple embedded fonts can be used in a program with each defining a different font with a different font number. 
-During execution MMBasic will skip over any DEFINEFONT commands so they can be placed anywhere in the program. 
-Any errors in the data format will be reported when the program is saved.
