[>266] DRAW3D SHOW n, x, y, z [,nocull] or DRAW3D WRITE n, x, y, z [,nocull]
DRAW3D SHOW , DRAW3D WRITE
This says that we want to position the centre of the object at coordinates x, y, z in our virtual 3D world. 
This command also projects the object 'n' onto the imaginary screen at "viewpoint" from the camera. 
The mechanism of projection interprets the relative position of the object in 3 dimensions and does full perspective compensation 
taking into account the relative positions of each vertex in three dimensional space relative to the viewplane and the x,y coordinates of the camera. 
As it displays the object it calculates the screen coordinates of the minimum rectangle into which the rendered object fits. 
This allows a subsequent SHOW command (but not WRITE command) to erase the previous render and draw the object onto a clean screen.
The firmware uses the technique of a combination of hidden face culling (faces pointing away from the viewer are not drawn) 
and Painter's algorithm (furthest face drawn first) to render the 3D object onto the viewplane.
Set nocull to 1 to disable hidden face culling and rely on Painter's algorithm for the display. Omit or set to 0 for normal culling. 
Setting nocull to 1 allows you to see inside hollow objects but decreases rendering efficiency and may result in artefacts on objects that have concave faces.
