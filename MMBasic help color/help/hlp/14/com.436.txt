[>437] MATH FFT MAGNITUDE signalarray!(),magnitudearray!() 
Generates magnitudes for frequencies for the data in "signalarray!" 
"signalarray" must be floating point and the size must be a power of 2 (e.g. s(1023) assuming OPTION BASE is zero) 
"magnitudearray" must be floating point and the size must be the same as the signal array 
The command will return the magnitude of the signal at various frequencies according to the formula: 
frequency at array position N = N * sample_frequency / number_of_samples
