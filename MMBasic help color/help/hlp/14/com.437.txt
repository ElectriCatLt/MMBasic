[>438] MATH FFT PHASE signalarray!(), phasearray!() 
Generates phases for frequencies for the data in  "signalarray!". 
"signalarray" must be floating point and the size must be a power of 2 (e.g. s(1023) assuming OPTION BASE is zero) 
"phasearray" must be floating point and the size must be the same as the signal array
The command will return the phase angle of the signal at various frequencies according to the formula  above.
