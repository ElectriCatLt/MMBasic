ALL VERSIONS
[>435] MATH FFT signalarray!(), FFTarray!() 
Performs a fast fourier transform of the data in "signalarray!". 
"signalarray" must be floating point and the size must be a power of 2 (e.g. s(1023) assuming OPTION  BASE is zero) 
"FFTarray" must be floating point and have dimension 2*N where N is the same as the signal array (e.g. f(1,1023) assuming OPTION BASE is zero) 
The command will return the FFT as complex numbers with the real part in f(0,n) and the imaginary part in f(1,n)
