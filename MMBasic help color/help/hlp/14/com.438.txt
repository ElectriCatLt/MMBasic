[>439] MATH SENSORFUSION type ax, ay, az, gx, gy, gz, mx, my, mz, pitch, roll, yaw [,p1] [,p2]
Type can be MAHONY or MADGWICK 
Ax, ay, and az are the accelerations in the three directions and should be specified in units of standard gravitational acceleration. 
Gx, gy, and gz are the instantaneous values of rotational speed which should be specified in radians per second. 
Mx, my, and mz are the magnetic fields in the three directions and should be specified in nano-Tesla (nT) 
Care must be taken to ensure that the x, y and z components are consistent between the three inputs. 
So , for example, using the MPU-9250 the correct input will be ax, ay,az, gx, gy, gz, my, mx, -mz based on the reading from the sensor. 
Pitch, roll and yaw should be floating point variables and will contain the outputs from the sensor fusion. 
The SENSORFUSION routine will automatically measure the time between consecutive calls and will use this in its internal calculations. 
The Madwick algorithm takes an optional parameter p1. This is used as beta in the calculation. 
It defaults to 0.5 if not specified The Mahony algorithm takes two optional parameters p1, and p2. 
These are used as Kp and Ki in the calculation. If not specified these default to 10.0 and 0.0 respectively. 
A fully worked example of using the code is given on the BackShed forum at:
