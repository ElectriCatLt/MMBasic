[>448] MEMORY PRINT #]fnbr , nbr, address%/array() MEMORY INPUT [#]fnbr , nbr, address%/array()
These commands save or read 'nbr' of data bytes from or to memory from or to an open disk file. 
The memory to be saved can be specified as an integer array in which case the nbr of bytes to be saved or read is checked against the array size. 
Alternatively, a memory address can be used in which case no checking can take place and user errors could result in a crash of the firmware..
