[>771] SPRITE(V,spriteno1,spriteno 2)   <- VGA AND HDMI VERSIONS ONLY
Returns the vector from 'spriteno1' to 'spriteno2' in radians.  
The angle is based on the clock so if 'spriteno2' is above 'spriteno1' on the screen then the answer will be zero. 
This can be used on any pair of sprites that are visible. If either sprite is not visible the function will return -1. 
This is particularly useful after a collision if the programmer wants to make some differential decision based on where the collision occurred. 
The angle is calculated between the centre of each of the sprites which may of course be different sizes.
