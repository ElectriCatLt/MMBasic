ALL VERSIONS
[>751] PORT(start, nbr [,start, nbr]...) 
Returns the value of a number of I/O pins in one operation. 
'start' is an I/O pin number and its value will be returned as bit 0. 
'start'+1 will be returned as bit 1, 'start'+2 will be returned as bit 2, and so on for 'nbr' number of bits. 
I/O pins used must be numbered consecutively and any I/O pin that is invalid or not configured as an input will cause an error. 
The start/nbr pair can be repeated up to 25 times if additional groups of input pins need to be added.  
This function will also return the state of a pin configured as an output. It can be used to conveniently communicate with parallel devices like memory chips. 
Any number of I/O pins (and therefore bits) can be used from 1 to the number of I/O pins on the chip. 
See the PORT command to simultaneously output to a number of pins.
