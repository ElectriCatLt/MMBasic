[>376] LONGSTRING AES128 ENCRYPT/DECRYPT CBC/ECB/CTR key$/key[!/%](), in%(), out%() [,iv$/iv[!/%]()]
Encrypts or decrypts the longstring in in%() putting the answer in out%() 
For CBC and CTR modes the encryption will generate a random initialisation vector and prepend out%() with the IV. 
If an explicit IV is specified this will be used instead of the random vector and this will be prepended to out%() 
For CBC and CTR decryption the firmware assumes that the first 16 bytes of in%() are the initialisation vector. 
In the case where you want to transmit a message without IV you can use LONGSTRING RIGHT to remove the IV before sending the message. 
In this case the recipient must know the IV as well as the key and create a complete longstring before using DECRYPT. 
This can be done by using LONGSTRING CONCAT to add the incoming message to a longstring containing the IV.
