[>626] WEB TCP READ cb%, buff%()
Read the data from a potential TCP connection' cb%'. 
' buff%()' is an array to receive any data from that connection as a longstring. 
The size of this buffer will limit the amount of data received from the remote client. 
If there is nothing received on that connection this will return an empty string (ie, LLEN(buff%())=0). 
If there is data that has been received then the BASIC program must respond with one of the WEB TRANSMIT commands in order to respond and close the connection.
