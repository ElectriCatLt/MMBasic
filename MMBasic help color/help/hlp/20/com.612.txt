[>613] WEB MQTT CONNECT addr$, port, user$, passwd$ [, interrupt]
Connect to an MQTT Broker. 
'addr$' is the IP address, 
'port' is the port number to use, 
'user$' is the user name, 
'passwd$' is the account's password and 
'interrupt' is optional and if specified is the subroutine to call when a message is received.

or where a previously configured network is not active or a previously configured network has failed to connect on boot (no parameters)
