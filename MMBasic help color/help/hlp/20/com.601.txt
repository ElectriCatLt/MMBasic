[>602] TRACE ON TRACE ON/OFF or  TRACE OFF or TRACE LIST nn 
Will turn on/off the trace facility. 
This facility will print the number of each line (counting from the beginning of the program) in square brackets as the program is executed. 
This is useful in debugging programs. Will list the last 'nn' lines executed in the format described above. 
MMBasic is always logging the lines executed so this facility is always available (i.e. it does not have to be turned on).
