[>148] OPTION HDMI PINS  clockpositivepin, d0positivepin, d1positivepin, d2positivepin 
Set the I/O pins used for the HDMI video output. 
This is only required to suit nonstandard PCB layouts. 
The positive HDMI signal pins are set according to 'nbr' below. 
Valid values are 0-7 and the pins must not overlap for each channel. 
If 'nbr' is an even number the negative output is on physical pin+1, if 'nbr' is odd it will be on physical pin-1.
