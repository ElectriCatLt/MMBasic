ALL VERSIONS
[>127] OPTION AUDIO I2S BCLKpin, DATApin
This allows a I2S DAC to be used to provide high quality Audio. The firmware transmits the data in 32-bit mode and FLAC, MP3, and WAV data is output with no loss of information.
This command reserves BCLKpin and BCLKpin+1 for the bit clock and word clock and Datapin for the I2S data. It requires an I2S DAC that can PLL the bitclock to create its own master clock. 
Tested on PCM5102A and TDA1387T , UDA1334A .

For example:
<CODE>
OPTION AUDIO I2S GP1,GP5
GP1 is the bit clock
GP2 is the word clock
GP5 is the data pin
</CODE>

All normal audio should work TONE, MP3, FLAC, WAV, MOD, SOUND
Note that you will see jitter on the BCLK. For the CPU at 150MHz the PIO needs to run at 44100*128 = 5644800 = 1/26.57 of the CPU clock speed. 
The way the H/W does this is to add or subtract clock ticks to the length of the PIO clock to give an average of 26.57 CPU ticks per PIO clock - hence jitter. 
I2S DAC could be enabled for RP2040. 
<CRED>
NB: for RP2040 VGA and WEB versions there are no PIO available for user use if I2S is enabled.RP2040 doesn't have enough memory or CPU to decode MP3

<CGRE>
NOTE: For VGA version the I2S PIO now shares with the VGA PIO (PIO0) so PIO 1 is available for use in MMBasic
