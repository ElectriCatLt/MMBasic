[>132] OPTION BREAK nn 
Set the value of the break key to the ASCII value 'nn'. 
This key is used  to interrupt a running program. 
The value of the break key is set to CTRL-C key at power up but it can be changed to any keyboard key using this command (for example, OPTION BREAK 4 will set the break key to the CTRL-D key). 
Setting this option to zero will disable the break function entirely.
