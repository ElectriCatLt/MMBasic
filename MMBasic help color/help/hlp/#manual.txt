This help is mostly copy of Picomites` family official manual but in form  of searchable text database.
As it is stored in SD card and in plain text format and does not take too much space, additional examples and reading materials can be added, comparing to official manual.
Any beta changes in firmwares, like new commands or functionality, can be added or removed fast and easy way with no need to re-print paper version of manual. 
Thanks to LIBRARY functionality, this help can be called typing 'help' in command prompt. Later user can get back to program editing.

Use should be simple. User just enter one word search phrase and help returns everything maching phrase. 
Try and enter 'DRAWING' and program will list in short form everything relateted to drawing - commands, functions or tutorials.
Every topic has number [nn]. If user enters >nn, topic will be listed in full format.
For example type RUN and program will list few topics. List begins with number [>59]
If user will type '>59' topic will be listed in full format.

Similar effect has key '-f' 
If user would enter 'RUN -f', same topics fill be listed, but this time in full format.

If user would type in '-x' or press 'ctrl+C' - program will exit. '-x' is more gracefull way to exit.
Key '-s" would list keyword suggestions.

It must be noted: search phrase is not case sensitive, but keys '-f', '-x', '-s' and '-h' are CASE SENSITIVE.

Manual can be built from main large file and following different flavours. 
Short or long version, black and white or color - it`s up to user`s choice. 
Hope this program will serve You well. Good luck!
