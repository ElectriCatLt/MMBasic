[>412] MATH WINDOW in(), minout, maxout, out() [,minin, maxin]
This command takes the "in" array and scales it between "minout" and "maxout" returning the answer in "out".  
Optionally, it can also return the minimum and maximum values found in the original data ("minin" and "minout").
<CGRE>
Note: "minout" can be greater than "maxout" and in this case the data will be both scaled and inverted.e.g 
</CGRE>

<CODE>
DIM IN(2)=(1,2,3)
DIM OUT(2)
MATH WINDOW IN(),7,3,OUT(),LOW,HIGH
</CODE>

Will return OUT(0)=7, OUT(1)=5,OUT(2)=3,LOW=1,HIGH=3
This command can massively simplify scaling data for plotting etc.
