[>413] MATH SLICE sourcearray(), [d1] [,d2] [,d3] [,d4] [,d5] , destinationarray() 
This command copies a specified set of values from a multi-dimensional array into a single dimensional array. 
It is much faster than using a FOR loop. 
The slice is specified by giving a value for all but one of the source array indices and there should be as many indices in the command, 
including the blank one, as there are dimensions in the source array e.g.
<CODE>
OPTION BASE 1
DIM a(3,4,5)
DIM b(4)
MATH SLICE a(), 2, , 3, b()
</CODE>

Will copy the elements 2,1,3 and 2,2,3 and 2,3,3 and 2,4,3 into array b()
