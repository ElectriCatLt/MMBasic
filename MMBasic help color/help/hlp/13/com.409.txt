[>410] MATH ADD in(), num ,out() 
This adds the value 'num' to every element of the matrix in() and puts the answer in out(). 
Works for arrays of any dimensionality of both integer and float and can convert between. 
Setting num to 0 is optimised and is a fast way of copying an entire array. 
in() and out() can be the same array.
