[>470] ONEWIRE RESET pin or ONEWIRE WRITE pin, flag, length, data [, data...] or  ONEWIRE READ pin, flag, length, data [, data...] 
Commands for communicating with 1-Wire devices. 
ONEWIRE RESET will reset the 1-Wire bus ONEWIRE WRITE will send a number of bytes ONEWIRE READ will read a number of bytes 
'pin' is the I/O pin (located in the rear connector) to use. It can be any pin capable of digital I/O. 
'flag' is a combination of the following options: 
<CGRE>
1 -Send reset before command 
2 -Send reset after command 
4 -Only send/recv a bit instead of a byte of data 
8 -Invoke a strong pullup after the command (the pin will be set high and open drain disabled) 
</CGRE>

'length' is the length of data to send or receive 'data' is the data to send or variable to receive. 
The number of data items must agree with the length parameter.

1-WIRE COMMUNICATIONS
</CGRE>

The 1-Wire protocol was developed by Dallas Semiconductor to communicate with chips using a single signalling line. 
This implementation was written for MMBasic by Gerard Sexton. There are three commands that you can use:
<CODE>
ONEWIRE RESET pin
</CODE>

Reset the 1-Wire bus
<CODE>
ONEWIRE WRITE pin, flag, length, data [, data…]
</CODE>

Send a number of bytes
<CODE>
ONEWIRE READ pin, flag, length, data [, data…]
</CODE>

Get a number of bytes
Where:
<CGRE>
pin - The I/O pin to use. It can be any pin capable of digital I/O.
</CGRE>

flag - A combination of the following options:
<CGRE>
1 - Send reset before command
2 - Send reset after command
4 - Only send/recv a bit instead of a byte of data
8 - Invoke a strong pullup after the command (the pin will be set high and open drain disabled)
</CGRE>

length - Length of data to send or receive data - Data to send or variable to receive.
The number of data items must agree with the length parameter.
The automatic variable MM.ONEWIRE returns true if a device was found 
After the command is executed, the I/O pin will be set to the not configured state unless flag option 8 is used.
When a reset is requested the automatic variable MM.ONEWIRE will return true if a device was found. 
This will occur with the ONEWIRE RESET command and the ONEWIRE READ and ONEWIRE WRITE commands if a reset was requested (flag = 1 or 2).
The 1-Wire protocol is often used in communicating with the DS18B20 temperature measuring sensor and to help in that regard MMBasic includes the TEMPR() function 
which provides a convenient method of directly reading the temperature of a DS18B20 without using these functions.
