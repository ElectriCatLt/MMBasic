[>471] OPEN fname$ FOR mode AS [#]fnbr 
Opens a file for reading or writing. 
'fname' is the filename with an optional extension separated by a dot (.). 
Long file names with upper and lower case characters are supported. A directory path can be specified with the backslash as directory separators. 
The parent of the current directory can be specified by using a directory name of .. (two dots) and the current directory with . (a single dot). 
For example 
<CODE>
OPEN "..\dir1\dir2\filename.txt" FOR INPUT AS #1 
</CODE>

'mode' is INPUT, OUTPUT, APPEND or RANDOM. 
INPUT will open the file for reading and throw an error if the file does not exist. 
OUTPUT will open the file for writing and will automatically overwrite any existing file with the same name. 
APPEND will also open the file for writing but it will not overwrite an existing file; instead any writes will be appended to the end of the file. 
<CGRE>
If there is no existing file the APPEND mode will act the same as the OUTPUT mode (i.e. the file is created then opened for writing). 
</CGRE>

RANDOM will open the file for both read and write and will allow random access using the SEEK command. 

When opened the read/write pointer is positioned at the end of the file. 'fnbr' is the file number (1 to 10).

RANDOM works the same as output and creates a file if one does not exist The # is optional. Up to 10 files can be open simultaneously. 

The INPUT, LINE INPUT, PRINT, WRITE and CLOSE commands as well as the EOF() and INPUT$() functions all use 'fnbr' to identify the file being operated on. 
See also ON ERROR and MM.ERRNO for error handling.
