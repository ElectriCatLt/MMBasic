ALL VERSIONS
[>475] PIN( pin ) = value 
For a 'pin' configured as digital output this will set the output to low ('value' is zero) or high ('value' non-zero). 
You can set an output high or low before it is configured as an output and that setting will be the default output when the SETPIN command takes effect. 
See the function PIN() for reading from a pin and the command SETPIN for configuring it. 
Refer to the chapter "Using the I/O pins" for a general description of the PicoMiteVGA 's input/output capabilities.
