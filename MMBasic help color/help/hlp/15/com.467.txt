ALL VERSIONS
[>468] ON KEY target or ON KEY ASCIIcode, target 
The first version of the command sets an interrupt which will call 'target' user defined subroutine 
whenever there is one or more characters waiting in the console input buffer. 
<CGRE>
Note that all characters waiting in the input buffer should be read in the interrupt subroutine 
</CGRE>

otherwise another interrupt will be automatically generated as soon as the program returns from the interrupt. 
The second version allows you to associate an interrupt routine with a specific key press. 
This operates at a low level for the console and if activated the key does not get put into the input buffer but merely triggers the interrupt. 
It uses a separate interrupt from the simple ON KEY command so can be used at the same time if required. 
In both variants, to disable the interrupt use numeric zero for the target, i.e.: ON KEY 0. or ON KEY ASCIIcode, 0
