ALL VERSIONS
[>466] ON ERROR SKIP 
Will ignore an error in a number of commands (specified by the number 'nn') executed following this command. 
'nn' is optional, the default if not specified is one. 
After the number of commands has completed (with an error or not) the behaviour of MMBasic will revert to ON ERROR ABORT. 
If an error occurs and is ignored/skipped the read only variable MM.ERRNO 
will be set to non zero and MM.ERRMSG$ will be set to the error message that would normally be generated. 
These are reset to zero and an empty string by ON ERROR CLEAR. 
They are also cleared when the program is run and when ON ERROR IGNORE and ON ERROR SKIP are used.
ON ERROR IGNORE can make it very difficult to debug a program so it is strongly recommended that only ON ERROR SKIP be used.
