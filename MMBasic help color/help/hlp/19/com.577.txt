VGA AND HDMI VERSIONS ONLY
[>578] SPRITE HIDE SAFE [#]n (VGA AND HDMI VERSIONS ONLY)
Removes sprite n from the display and replaces the stored background. Automatically hides all more recent sprites as well as the requested one and then replaces them afterwards. 
This ensures that sprites that are covered by other sprites can be removed without the user tracking the write order. 
Of course this version is less performant than the simple version and should only be used it there is a risk of the sprite being partially covered.
