VGA AND HDMI VERSIONS ONLY
[>591] SPRITE SHOW SAFE [#]n, x,y, layer [,orientation] [,ontop] (VGA AND HDMI VERSIONS ONLY)
Shows a sprite and automatically compensates for any other sprites that overlap it. 
If the sprite is not already being displayed the command acts exactly the same as SPRITE SHOW. 
If the sprite is already shown it is moved and remains in its position relative to other sprites based on the original order of writing. 
i.e. if sprite 1 was written before sprite 2 and it is moved to overlap sprite 2 it will display under sprite 2. 
If the optional "ontop" parameter is set to 1 then the sprite moved will become the newest sprite and will sit on top of any other sprite it overlaps. 
Refer to SPRITE SHOW for details of the orientation parameter.
