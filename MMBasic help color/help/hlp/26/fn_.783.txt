[>784] TIMER 
Returns the elapsed time in milliseconds (e.g. 1/1000 of a second) since reset. 
The timer is reset to zero on power up or a CPU restart and you can also reset it by using TIMER as a command. 
If not specifically reset it will continue to count up forever (it is a 64 bit number and therefore will only roll over to zero after 200 million years).
