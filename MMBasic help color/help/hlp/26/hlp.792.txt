[>793] Editing the Command Line
When entering a line at the command prompt the line can be edited using the left and right arrow keys to move along the line, the Delete key to delete a character, 
the Backspace to delete before the cursor and the Insert key to switch between insert and overwrite modes.
Home/End will move to the beginning/end of the line and Home pressed twice will terminate the edit. At any point the Enter key will send the line to MMBasic which will execute it. 
The up and down arrow keys will move through a history of previously entered command lines which can be edited and reused.
