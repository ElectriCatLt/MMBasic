ALL VERSIONS
[>788] HARDWARE - Clock Speed
By default the clock speed for the RP2040 used in the Raspberry Pi Pico is 133MHz and for the RP2350 used in the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 is 150MHz. These are the recommended maximums. 
Using the OPTION CPUSPEED command, most RP2040 CPUs can be overclocked up to 420MHz or 396MHz for the RP2350. They can also run slower to a minimum of 48MHz. 
This option is saved and will be reapplied on power up. When changing the clock speed the PicoMite firmware will be reset then rebooted so the USB connection will be disconnected.
Versions with VGA video have the clock set to 126MHz however this can be changed using OPTION CPUSPEED to 157.5MHz, 252MHz, 315MHz or 378MHz.
Versions with HDMI video have the clock speed fixed at 315MHz, 324MHz or 372MHz depending on the video resolution selected and this cannot be changed.
Nearly all tested Raspberry Pi Picos have worked correctly at 380MHz or more, so overclocking can be useful.
If the processor fails to restart at its new clock speed you can reset it by loading this firmware file listed under the heading Loading the Firmware to reset the Pico to its factory fresh state.
