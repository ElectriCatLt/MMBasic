ALL VERSIONS
[>659] DIR$( fspec, type ) or DIR$( fspec )  or DIR$( )
Will search an SD card for files and return the names of entries found. or 'fspec' is a file specification using wildcards 
the same as used by the FILES command. E.g. "*.*" will return all entries, "*.TXT" will return text files.  
<CGRE>
Note that the wildcard *.* does not find files or folders without an extension. 
</CGRE>

'type' is the type of entry to return and can be one of: 
<CGRE>
VOL Search for the volume label only 
DIR Search for directories only 
FILE Search for files only (the default if 'type' is not specified) The function will return the first entry found. 
</CGRE>

To retrieve subsequent entries use the function with no arguments. i.e. DIR$( ). 
The return of an empty string indicates that there are no more entries to retrieve. This example will print all the files in a directory:
<CODE>
f$ = DIR$("*.*", FILE) 
DO WHILE f$ <> "" 
PRINT f$ 
f$ = DIR$() 
LOOP 
</CODE>

You must change to the required directory before invoking this command.
