[>12] MM.STARTUP
There may be a need to execute some code on initial power up, perhaps to initialise some hardware, set some options or print a custom start-up banner. 
This can be accomplished by creating a subroutine with the name MM.STARTUP. 
When the PicoMite firmware is first powered up or reset it will search for this subroutine and, if found, it will be run once.
For example, if the Raspberry Pi Pico has a real time clock attached, the program could contain the following code:
<CODE>
SUB MM.STARTUP
RTC GETTIME
END SUB
</CODE>

This would cause the internal clock within MMBasic to be set to the current time on every power up or reset.
After the code in MM.STARTUP has been run MMBasic will continue with running the rest of the program in program memory. 
If there is no other code MMBasic will return to the command prompt. 
<CGRE>
Note that you should not use MM.STARTUP for general setup of MMBasic (like dimensioning arrays, opening communication channels, etc) before running a program. 
</CGRE>

The reason is that when you use the RUN command MMBasic will first clear the interpreter's state ready for a fresh start.
