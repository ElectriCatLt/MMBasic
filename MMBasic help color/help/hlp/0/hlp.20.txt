VGA VERSIONS
[>21] HDMI Video
For versions of the firmware that support HDMI video the following table lists the connections to the standard HDMI Type A socket. 
The HDMI output is automatically enabled at startup - there are no options that need to be set.
To generate the DVI/HDMI signal the firmware needs to overclock the RP2350 to as high as 372MHz and most Raspberry Pi Pico 2 modules will not have any trouble at these speeds. 
However, this cannot be guaranteed, especially with third party modules. 
An example is the Pimoroni Pico Plus 2 which cannot be overclocked to the required speeds and therefore cannot be used with the HDMI versions of the PicoMite firmware.
Similar to how VGA is generated, the output of MMBasic is written to a framebuffer which, using the second CPU and DMA, is fed to the HSTX peripheral which in turn generates the parallel video data. 
The video signal produced is actually DVI (HDMI supports DVI) so this means that audio is not supported on the HDMI output and sophisticated HDMI features 
such as High Definition Content Protection (HDCP) and Ethernet are also not supported.
HDMI video supports a number of resolutions. To set these you use the following command:
<CODE>
OPTION RESOLUTION nn
</CODE>

Where 'nn' is 640x480 or 640 or 1280x720 or 1280 or 1024x768 or 1024.
Each HDMI resolution can operate in a number of modes which are set using the MODE command. 
<CGRE>
Note that many modes reduce the displayed resolution to save memory for other features, 
this reduction is done by doubling or quadrupling each pixel, however the monitor will always see the resolution (ie, pixel density) set by the OPTION RESOLUTION command:
</CGRE>
<CODE>
OPTION RESOLUTION 640x480
</CODE>

MODE 1
Displayed image 640x480 in monochrome RGB555 tiles (use the TILE command)
MODE 2
Displayed image 320x240 in 16 colours with colour mapping to an RGB555 palette Two optional layers
MODE 3
Displayed image 640x480 in 16 colours with colour mapping to an RGB555 palette One optional layer
MODE 4
Displayed image 320x240 in 32,768 colours. One optional layer 
MODE 5
Displayed image 320x240 in 256 colours with colour mapping to an RGB555 palette Two optional layers

<CODE>
OPTION RESOLUTION 1280x720
</CODE>

MODE 1<MRK>7,1,7
Displayed image 1280x720 in monochrome RGB332 tiles (use the TILE command)
MODE 2<MRK>7,1,7
Displayed image 320x180 in 16 colours with colour mapping to an RGB332 palette Two optional layers
MODE 3<MRK>7,1,7
Displayed image 640x360 in 16 colours with colour mapping to an RGB332 palette One optional layer
MODE 5<MRK>7,1,7
Displayed image 320x180 in 256 colours with colour mapping to an RGB332 palette Two optional layers

<CODE>
OPTION RESOLUTION 1024x768
</CODE>

MODE 1<MRK>7,1,7
Displayed image 1024x768 in monochrome RGB332 tiles (use the TILE command)
MODE 2<MRK>7,1,7
Displayed image 256x192 in 16 colours with colour mapping to an RGB332 palette Two optional layers
MODE 3<MRK>7,1,7
Displayed image 512x384 in 16 colours with colour mapping to an RGB332 palette One optional layer
MODE 5<MRK>7,1,7
Displayed image 256x192 in 256 colours with colour mapping to an RGB332 palette Two optional layers

The default is RESOLUTION 640x480 and MODE 1
