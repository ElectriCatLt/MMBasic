[>208] BLIT LOAD[BMP] [#]b, fname$ [,x] [,y] [,w] [,h]
BLIT LOAD will load a blit buffer from a 24-bit bmp image file. x,y define the start position in the image to start loading and w,h specify the width 
and height of the area to be loaded. This command will work on most display 
panels (not just panels using the ILI9341 controller). Eg, 
<CODE>
BLIT LOAD #1,"image1", 50,50,100,100 
</CODE>
will load an area of 100 pixels square with the top left had corner at 50,50 from the image image1.bmp
