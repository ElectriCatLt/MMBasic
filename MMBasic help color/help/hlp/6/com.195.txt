ALL VERSIONS
[>196] ADC OPEN freq, n_channels [,interrupt] 
This allocates up to 4 ADC channels for use and sets them to be converted at the specified frequency. The range of pins are GP26, GP27, GP28, and GP29 for the RP2940 and RP2350A. 
Plus GP55, GP56, GP57, GP58 on the RP2350B. 
If the number of channels is one then it will always be GP26 used, if two then GP26 and GP27 are used, etc. 
Sampling of multiple channels is sequential (there is only one ADC). The pins are locked to the function when ADC OPEN is active 
The maximum total frequency is CPUspeed/96 (eg, 346KHz if all four channels are to be sampled with the CPU set at 133MHz). 
<CGRE>
Note that a aggregate sampling frequency over 500Khz is overclocking the ADC. 
</CGRE>

The optional interrupt parameter specifies an interrupt to call when the conversion completes. If not specified then conversion will be blocking
