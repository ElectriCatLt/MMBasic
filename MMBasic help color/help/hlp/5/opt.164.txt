NON USB FIRMWARE ONLY
[>165] OPTION MOUSE CLKpin, DATApin 
Set the pins to be used to connect a PS2 mouse. 
Using this command the mouse is automatically configured on boot and you can set up interrupts and read values with no additional commands. 
This is different from the MOUSE OPEN which only connects to a mouse while the program is running. 
The PS2 mouse MUST be is disabled.

NOTE: The mouse only works in the editor in mode 1. This is because it uses the tile mechanism do do the highlighting. If you are in mode 2 the editor automatically switches to mode 1 during the edit hence that also works.
