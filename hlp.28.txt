[>29] A Tutorial - Programming in BASIC
The BASIC language was introduced in 1964 by Dartmouth College in the USA as a computer language for teaching programming and accordingly it is easy to use and learn. 
At the same time, it has proved to be a competent and powerful programming language and as a result it became very popular in the late 70s and early 80s. 
Even today some large commercial data systems are still written in the BASIC language (primarily Pick Basic).
The BASIC interpreter used in the PicoMite firmware's is called MMBasic and is a modern version of the BASIC language which loosely emulates the Microsoft BASIC interpreter that was popular years ago.
For a programmer the greatest advantage of BASIC is its ease of use. Some more modern languages such as C and C++ can be truly mind bending 
but with BASIC you can start with a one line program and get something sensible out of it. 
MMBasic is also powerful in that you can draw sophisticated graphics, manipulate the external I/O pins to control other devices and communicate with other devices 
using a range of built-in communications protocols.
