[>7] Power Consumption
The power consumption is dependent on the clock speed, however at the default clock speed (133MHz for the RP2040 and 150MHz for the RP2350), 
the typical power consumption is 20mA. This does not include any current sourced or sunk by the I/O pins or the 3V3 pin:
The power consumption for the WebMite version for the Raspberry Pi Pico W is the same at 20mA with the WiFi disabled but, when the WiFi is enabled, the power consumption will rise to 40 to 70mA.
