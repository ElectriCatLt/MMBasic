ALL VERSIONS
[>13] MM.PROMPT
If a subroutine with this name exists it will be automatically executed by MMBasic instead of displaying the command prompt. 
This can be used to display a custom prompt, set colours, define variables, etc all of which will be active at the command prompt.
<CGRE>
Note that MMBasic will clear all variables and I/O pin settings when a program is run so anything set in this subroutine will only be valid 
</CGRE>

for commands typed at the command prompt (i.e. in immediate mode).
As an example the following will display a custom prompt:
<CODE>
SUB MM.PROMPT
PRINT TIME$ "> ";
END SUB
</CODE>
<CGRE>
Note that while constants can be defined, they will not be visible because a constant defined inside a subroutine is local to a subroutine. 
However, DIM will create variables that are global that that should be used instead.
</CGRE>
