[>666] FIX( number ) 
Truncate a number to a whole number by eliminating the decimal point and all characters to the right of the decimal point. 
For example 9.89 will return 9 and -2.11 will return -2. 
The major difference between FIX() and INT() is that FIX() provides a true integer function (i.e. does not return the next lower number for negative numbers as INT() does). 
This behaviour is for Microsoft compatibility. 
See also CINT() .
