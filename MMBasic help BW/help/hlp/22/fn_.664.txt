[>665] FIELD$( string1, nbr, string2 [, string3] ) 
Returns a particular field in a string with the fields separated by delimiters. 
'nbr' is the field to return (the first is nbr 1). 'string1' is the string to search and 'string2' is a string holding the delimiters (more than one can be used). 
'string3' is optional and if specified will include characters that are used to quote text in 'string1' (ie, quoted text will not be searched for a delimiter). 
For example: 
S$ = "foo, boo, zoo, doo" 
r$ = FIELD$(s$, 2, ",") 
will result in r$ = "boo". While: 
s$ = "foo, 'boo, zoo', doo" 
r$ = FIELD$(s$, 2, ",", "'") 
will result in r$ = "boo, zoo".
