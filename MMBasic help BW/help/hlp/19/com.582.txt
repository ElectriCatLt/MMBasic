[>583] SPRITE LOADARRAY [#]n, w, h, array%() (VGA AND HDMI VERSIONS ONLY)
Creates the sprite 'n' with width 'w' and height 'h' by reading w*h RGB888 values from 'array%()'. 
The RGB888 values must be stored in order of columns across and then rows down starting at the top left. 
This allows the programmer to create simple sprites in a program without needing to load them from disk or read them from the display. 
The firmware will generate an error if 'array%()' is not big enough to hold the number of values required.
