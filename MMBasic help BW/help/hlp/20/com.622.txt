[>623] WEB TCP CLIENT STREAM command$, buffer%(), readpointer%, writepointer%
Connects to a server previously opened with WEB OPEN TCP STREAM. 
'command$' is a string and is the request to be sent to the server. 
'buffer%()' is an integer array which will receive the ongoing responses and acts as a  circular buffer of bytes received. 
The firmware maintains the parameter 'writepointer%' as the data from the server arrives.
'readpointer%' should be maintained by the Basic program as it removes data from the circular buffer. 
If 'writepointer%' catches up with 'readpointer%' then 'readpointer%' will be incremented to stay one byte ahead and incoming data will be lost. 
This command is designed to be compatible with the PLAY STREAM command to allow the implementation of streaming internet audio.
