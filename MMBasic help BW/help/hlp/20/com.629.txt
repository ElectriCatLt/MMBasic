[>630] WEB TRANSMIT PAGE cb%, filename$ [,buffersize]
Constructs an HTTP 1.1 header, sends it and then sends the contents of the file to the open TCP connection cb% and on completion closes the connection. 
MMBasic will substitute current values for any MMBasic variables or expressions defined in the file inside curly brackets eg, {myvar%}. 
Variables can be simple, array elements or expressions. An opening curly bracket can be included in the output by using {{. 
By default the command allocates a buffer the size of the file + 4096 bytes to build the page to transmit. 
However, if the page is complex and includes many MMBasic variables that yield text bigger than the variable name 
it is possible that the buffer will not be big enough. In this case the user can specify the extra space required (defaults to 4096 if not specified)
