[>627] WEB TCP SEND cb%, data%() or WEB TCP CLOSE cb%
These two commands allow more flexibility in using the TCP server. 
Unlike WEB TRANSMIT PAGE or WEB TRANSMIT FILE, WEB TCP SEND does not create any sort of header, nor does it close the TCP connection after transmission. 
It just sends exactly what is in the LONGSTRING data%() and it is up to the Basic programmer to close the connection when appropriate.
