[>32] A Tutorial - COMMENTS
If MMBasic runs into a comment it will just skip to the end of it (ie, it does not take any action regarding a comment).
Comments should be used to explain non obvious parts of the program and generally inform someone who is not familiar with the program how it works and what it is trying to do. 
Remember that after only a few months a program that you have written will have faded from your mind and will look strange when you pick it up again. 
For this reason you will thank yourself later if you use plenty of comments. 

The following are some examples of comments:
' calculate the hypotenuse
PRINT SQR(a * a + b * b)
or
INPUT var ' get the temperature
Older BASIC programs used the command REM to start a comment and you can also use that if you wish but the single quote character is easier to use and more convenient.
