[>45] A Tutorial - SCIENTIFIC NOTATION
Most numbers can be written normally, for example 11 or 24.5, but very large or small numbers are more difficult. 
For example, it has been estimated that the number of grains of sand on planet Earth is 7500000000000000000. 
The problem with this number is that you can easily lose track of how many zeros there are in the number and consequently it is difficult to compare this with a similar sized number.
A scientist would write this number as 7.5 x 1018 which is called scientific notation and is much easier to comprehend.
MMBasic will automatically shift to scientific notation when dealing with very large or small floating point numbers. 
For example, if the above number was stored in a floating point variable the PRINT command would display it as 7.5E+18 (this is BASIC's way of representing 7.5 x 1018). 
As another example, the number 0.0000000456 would display as 4.56E-8 which is the same as 4.56 x 10-8.
You can also use scientific notation when entering constant numbers in MMBasic. 
For example:
SandGrains = 7.5E+18
MMBasic only uses scientific notation for displaying floating point numbers (not integers). For instance, if you assigned the number of grains of sand to an integer variable it would print out as a normal number (with lots of zeros).
