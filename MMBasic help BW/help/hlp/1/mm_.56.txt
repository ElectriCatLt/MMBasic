[>57] MM.ERRMSG$  
If a statement caused an error which was ignored these variables will be set accordingly. MM.ERRNO is a number where non zero means that 
there was an error and MM.ERRMSG$ is a string representing the error message 
that would have normally been displayed on the console. They are reset to zero and an empty string by RUN, ON ERROR IGNORE or ON ERROR SKIP.
