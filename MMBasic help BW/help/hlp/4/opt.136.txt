NOT ON HDMI VERSIONS
[>137] OPTION CPUSPEED 
Change the CPU clock speed. 'speed' is the CPU clock in KHz in the range of 48000 to 378000. 
Speeds above 133MHz (150MHz for the RP2350) are regarded as overclocking as that is the specified maximum speed of the standard Raspberry Pi Pico. 
For VGA versions valid speeds are 126, 157.5, 252, 315, and 378MHz. The default is 126MHz. 
For other versions the CPU speed will default to 133000 (150000 for RP2350). 
This command must be run at the command prompt (not in a program).
