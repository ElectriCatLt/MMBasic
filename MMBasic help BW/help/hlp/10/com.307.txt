[>308] FOR counter = start TO finish [STEP increment] 
Initiates a FOR-NEXT loop with the variable 'counter' initially set to 'start' [STEP increment] and incrementing in 'increment' steps (default is 1) until 'counter' is greater than 'finish'. 
The 'increment' can be an integer or a floating point number. 
Note that using a floating point fractional number for 'increment' can accumulate rounding errors in 'counter' which could cause the loop to terminate early or late. 

'increment' can be negative in which case 'finish' should be less than 'start' and the loop will count downwards. 
See also the NEXT command.
