[>321] FRAMEBUFFER LAYER [colour] HDMI AND VGA VERSIONS ONLY
Creates a layer buffer "L" with a colour space and resolution to match the current display mode. 
The optional parameter colour is specified as a number 0-15 (modes 2 and 3), RGB888 colour (mode 4) or 0-255 (mode 5) and specifies a colour which is ignored when the layer is applied to the display. 
In display modes where automatic layer application is not supported a layer buffer acts as another framebuffer.
