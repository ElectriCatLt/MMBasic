ALL VERSIONS
[>307] FONT [#]font-number, scaling 
This will set the default font for displaying text on the VGA output. Fonts are specified as a number. 
For example, #2 (the # is optional). See  Graphics Commands and Functions for details of the available fonts. 
'scaling' can range from 1 to 15 and will multiply the size of the pixels making the displayed character correspondingly wider and higher. E.g. a scale of 2 will double the height and width.
