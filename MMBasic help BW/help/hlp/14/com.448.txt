MEMORY UNPACK source%()/sourceaddress%, dest%()/destaddress%, number, size
Memory pack and unpack allow integer values from one array to be compressed into another or uncompressed from one to the other. 
The two arrays are always normal integer arrays but the packed array can have 2, 4, 8, 16 or 64 values "packed into them. 
Thus a single integer array element could store 2 off 32-bit words, 4 off 16 bit values, 8 bytes, 16 nibbles, or 64 booleans (bits). 
"number specifies the number of values to be packed or unpacked and "size" specifies the number of bits (1,4,8,16,or 32) 
Alternatively, memory address(es) can be used in which case no checking can take place and user errors could result in a crash of the firmware.
