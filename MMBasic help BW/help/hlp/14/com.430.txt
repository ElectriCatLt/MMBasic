[>431] MATH Q_EULER yaw, pitch, roll, outRQ() 
Generates a normalised rotation quaternion outRQ() to rotate quaternion vectors as defined by the yaw, pitch and roll angles 
With the vector in front of the "viewer" yaw is looking from the top of the ector and rotates clockwise, pitch rotates the top away from the camera and roll  rotates around the z-axis clockwise. 
The yaw, pitch and roll angles default to radians but respect the setting of  OPTION ANGLE
