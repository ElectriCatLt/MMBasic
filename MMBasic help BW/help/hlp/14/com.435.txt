[>436] MATH FFT INVERSE FFTarray!(), signalarray!() 
Performs an inverse fast fourier transform of the data in "FFTarray!". "FFTarray" must be floating point and have dimension 2*N 
where N must be a power of 2 (e.g. f(1,1023) assuming OPTION BASE is zero) with the real part in f(0,n) and the imaginary part in f(1,n).
"signalarray" must be floating point and the single dimension must be the same as the FFT array. 
The command will return the real part of the inverse transform in "signalarray".
