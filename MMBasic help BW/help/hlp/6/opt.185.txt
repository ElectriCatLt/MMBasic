[>186] OPTION TOUCH FT6336 IRQpin, RESETpin [,BEEPpin] [,sensitivity]
Configures MMBasic for the touch sensitive feature of an attached LCD panel. 
'T_CS pin' and 'T_IRQ pin' are the I/O pins to be used for chip select and touch interrupt respectively (any free pins can be used). 
The remaining pins are connected to those specified using the OPTION SYSTEM SPI command. 
'Beep' is an optional pin which can be connected to a small buzzer/beeper to generate a "click" or beep sound when an Advanced Graphics control is touched 
(ie, radio button, switch, etc). This is described in Advanced Graphics Functions.pdf. This command must be run at the command prompt (not in a program).
'sensitivity' is a number between 0 and 255 - defaults to 50, lower is more sensitive. 
SDA and SCK should be connected to valid I2C pins and set up with OPTION SYSTEM I2C
TOUCH function works as before + TOUCH(X2) and TOUCH(Y2) returns the position of a second touch location or -1 if no second location is touched.
