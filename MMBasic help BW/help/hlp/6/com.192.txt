/* ...........  */ 
Start and end of multiline comments. /* and */ must be the first non-space characters at the start of a line and have a space or end-of-line after them (i.e. they are MMBasic commands). 
Multi-line comments cannot be used inside subroutines and functions. Any characters after */ on a line are also treated as  a comment.
