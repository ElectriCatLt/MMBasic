[>206] BLIT READ [#]b, x, y, w, h 
BLIT READ will copy a portion of the display to the memory buffer '#b'. 
The source coordinate is 'x' and 'y' and the width of the display area to copy is 'w' and the height is 'h'. 
When this command is used the memory buffer is automatically created and sufficient memory allocated. 
This buffer can be freed and the memory recovered with the BLIT CLOSE command.
