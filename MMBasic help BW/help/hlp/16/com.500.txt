Play a series of sounds simultaneously on the audio output. 'soundno' is the sound number 
and can be from 1 to 4 allowing for four simultaneous sounds on each channel. 
'channelno' specifies the output channel. It can be L (left speaker), R (right speaker) or B (both speakers) 
'type' is the type of waveform. It can be S (sine wave), Q (square wave), T (triangle wave), W (rising sawtooth) or O (turn off sound). 
'frequency' is the frequency from 1 to 20000 (Hz) and it must be specified except when type is O. 
'volume' is optional and must be between 1 and 25. It defaults to 25 
The first time PLAY SOUND is called all other audio usage will be blocked and will remain blocked until PLAY STOP is called. 
Output can be stopped  temporarily using PLAY PAUSE and PLAY RESUME. 
Calling SOUND on an already running 'soundno' will immediately replace  the previous output. 
Individual sounds are turned off using type "O" 
Running 4 sounds simultaneously on both channels of the audio output consumes about 23% of the CPU.
