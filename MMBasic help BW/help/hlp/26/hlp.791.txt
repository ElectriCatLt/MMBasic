[>792] Using MMBasic - Program Structure
A BASIC program starts at the first line and continues until it runs off the end of the program or hits an END command - at which point MMBasic will display the command prompt (>) on the console and wait for something to be entered.
A program consists of a number of statements or commands, each of which will cause the BASIC interpreter to do something (the words statement and command generally mean the same and are used interchangeably). 
Normally each statement is on its own line but you can have multiple statements in the one line separated by the colon character (:). For example.
A = 24.6 : PRINT A
The BASIC language was introduced in 1964 by Dartmouth College in the USA as a computer language for teaching programming and accordingly it is easy to use and learn. 
At the same time, it has proved to be a competent and powerful programming language and as a result it became very popular in the late 70s and early 80s. 
Even today some large commercial data systems are still written in the BASIC language (primarily Pick Basic).
The BASIC interpreter used in the PicoMite firmware's is called MMBasic and is a modern version of the BASIC language which loosely emulates the Microsoft BASIC interpreter that was popular years ago.
For a programmer the greatest advantage of BASIC is its ease of use. Some more modern languages such as C and C++ can be truly mind bending but with BASIC you can start with a one line program and get something sensible out of it. 
MMBasic is also powerful in that you can draw sophisticated graphics, manipulate the external I/O pins to control other devices and communicate with otherdevices using a range of built-in communications protocols.
