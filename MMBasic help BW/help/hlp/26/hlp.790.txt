[>791] Commands and Program Input
At the command prompt you can enter a command and it will be immediately run. 
Most of the time you will do this to tell the PicoMite firmware to do something like run a program or set an option. 
But this feature also allows you to test out commands at the command prompt.
To enter a program the easiest method is to use the EDIT command. 
This will invoke the full screen program editor which is built into the PicoMite firmware and is described later in this manual. 
It includes advanced features such as search and copy, cut and paste to and from a clipboard.
You could also compose the program on your desktop computer using something like Notepad and then 
transfer it to the Raspberry Pi Pico via the XModem protocol (see the XMODEM command) or by streaming it up the console serial link (see the AUTOSAVE command).
One thing that you cannot do is use the old BASIC way of entering a program which was to prefix each line with a line number. 
Line numbers are optional in MMBasic so you can still use them if you wish but if you enter a line with a line number at the prompt MMBasic will simply execute it immediately.
