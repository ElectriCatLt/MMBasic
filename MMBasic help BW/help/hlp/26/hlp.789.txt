[>790] Obsolete commands and functions 
These commands and functions are mostly included to assist in converting programs written for Microsoft BASIC. 
For new programs the corresponding modern commands in MMBasic should be used.
Note that these commands/functions may be removed in the future to recover memory for other features.

BITBANG         Replaced by the command DEVICE. For compatibility BITBANG can still be used in programs and will be automatically converted to DEVICE 
DEVICE CAMERA   Changed to the CAMERA command
DEVICE GAMEPAD  Changed to the GAMEPAD command
DEVICE HUMID    Changed to the HUMID command
DEVICE KEYPAD   Changed to the KEYPAD command
DEVICE MOUSE    Changed to the MOUSE command
DEVICE LCD      Changed to the LCD command
DEVICE WII      Changed to the WII command
DEVICE WS2812   Changed to the WS2812 command
GOSUB target    Initiates a subroutine call to the target, which can be a line number or a label. The subroutine must end with RETURN.
New programs should use defined subroutines (i.e. SUB...END SUB). 
IF condition THEN linenbr
                For Microsoft compatibility a GOTO is assumed if the THEN statement is followed by a number. A label is invalid in this construct.
                New programs should use: IF condition THEN GOTO linenbr | label 
IRETURN         Returns from an interrupt when the interrupt destination was a line number or a label. New programs should use a user defined subroutine as an interrupt destination.
In that case END SUB or EXIT SUB will cause a return from the interrupt.
ON nbr GOTO | GOSUB target[,target, target,..]
                ON either branches (GOTO) or calls a subroutine (GOSUB) based on the rounded value of 'nbr'; if it is 1, the first target is called, if 2, the second targetis called, etc. 
                Target can be a line number or a label. New programs should use SELECT CASE.
MM.HPOS / MM.VPOS
                Replaced by MM.INFO(HPOS) and MM.INFO(VPOS).
MM.VER          MMBasic version number. Replaced by MM,INFO(VERSION)..
MM.FONTHEIGHT / MM.FONTWIDTH
                Integers representing the height and width of the current font (in pixels) kept for compatibility. 
                Note: these are automatically converted into MM.INFO(FONTHEIGHT) and MM.INFO(FONTWIDTH) when the program is loaded.

POS             For the console, returns the current cursor position in the line in characters.
RETURN          RETURN concludes a subroutine called by GOSUB and returns to the statement after the GOSUB.
