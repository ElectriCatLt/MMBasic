ALL VERSIONS
[>797] Using MMBasic - Saved Variables
This can be done with the VAR SAVE command which will save the variables listed on its command line in non-volatile flash memory. 
The space reserved for saved variables is 16KB. 
These variables can be restored with the VAR RESTORE command which will add all the saved variables to the variable table of the running program. 
Normally this command is placed near the start of a program so that the variables are ready for use by the program. This facility is intended for saving calibration data, user selected options and other items which change infrequently. 
It should not be used for high-speed saves as you may wear out the flash memory. The flash used for the Raspberry Pi Pico has a high endurance but this can be exceeded by a program that repeatedly saves variables. 
If you do want to save data often you should add a real time clock chip. The RTC commands can then be used to store and retrieve data from the RTC's battery backed memory. 
See the RTC command for more details.
