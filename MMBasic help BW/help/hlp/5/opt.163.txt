[>164] OPTION MODBUFF ENABLE/DISABLE [sizeinK]
Creates or removes an area of flash memory used for loading and playing .MOD files. 
If enabled then a mod buffer is created with a size of 128Kbytes. 
This can be overridden with "sizeinK". 
Note that this option reserves part of the Flash Filesystem (ie, it shrinks the Flash Filesystem). 

The default is disabled.
