[>752] PULSIN( pin, polarity ) or PULSIN( pin, polarity, t1 ) or PULSIN( pin, polarity, t1, t2 ) 
Measures the width of an input pulse from 1us to 1 second with 0.1us resolution.  
'pin' is the I/O pin to use for the measurement, it must be previously configured as a digital input. 
'polarity' is the type of pulse to measure, if zero the function will return the width of the next negative pulse, if non zero it will measure the next positive pulse. 
't1' is the timeout applied while waiting for the pulse to arrive, 
't2' is the timeout used while measuring the pulse. Both are in microseconds (us) and are optional. If 't2' is omitted the value of 't1' will be used for both timeouts. 
If both 't1' and 't2' are omitted then the timeouts will be set at 100000 (i.e. 100ms). 
This function returns the width of the pulse in microseconds (us) or -1 if a timeout has occurred. 
The measurement is accurate to ±0.5% and ±0.5us
Note that this function will cause the running program to pause while the measurement is made and interrupts will be ignored during this period.
