[>99] MM.INFO(STACK)
Returns the C stack pointer. Complex or recursive Basic code may result in the error "Stack overflow, expression too complex at depth %" 
This will occur when the stack is below &H 2003f800. 
Monitoring the stack will allow the programmer to identify simplifications to the Basic code to avoid the error.
