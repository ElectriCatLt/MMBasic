ALL VERSIONS
[>735] PIN( pin ) 
Returns the value on the external I/O 'pin'. Zero means digital low, 1 means digital high and for analogue inputs it will return the measured voltage as a floating point number. Frequency inputs will return the frequency in Hz. 
A period input will return the period in milliseconds while a count input will return the count since reset (counting is done on the positive rising edge). 
The count input can be reset to zero by resetting the pin to counting input (even if it is already so configured). This function will also return the state of a pin configured as an output.
Also see the SETPIN and PIN() = commands. 
Refer to the chapter "Using the I/O pins" for a general description of the PicoMiteVGA 's input/output  capabilities.
