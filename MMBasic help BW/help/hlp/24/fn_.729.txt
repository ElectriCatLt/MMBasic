PEEK(WORD addr%) 
PEEK(INTEGER addr%) 
PEEK(FLOAT addr%) 
PEEK(VARADDR var) 
PEEK(CFUNADDR cfun) 
PEEK(VAR var, ±offset)

Will return a byte or a word within the PIC32 virtual memory space. 
BYTE will return the byte (8-bits) located at 'addr%' 
SHORT will return the short integer (16-bits) located at 'addr%' 
WORD will return the word (32-bits) located at 'addr%' 
INTEGER will return the integer (64-bits) located at 'addr%' 
FLOAT will return the floating point number (32-bits) located at 'addr%' 
VARADDR will return the address (32-bits) of the variable 'var' in memory. An array is specified as var(). 
CFUNADDR will return the address (32-bits) of the CFunction 'cfun' in memory. This address can be passed to another CFunction which can then call it to perform some common process. 
VAR, will return a byte in the memory allocated to 'var'. An array is specified as var(). 
VARTBL, will return a byte in the memory allocated to the variable table maintained by MMBasic. 
Note that there is a comma after the keyword VARTBL. 

PROGMEM, will return a byte in the memory allocated to the program. 
Note that there is a comma after the keyword PROGMEM. 
Note that 'addr%' should be an integer.
