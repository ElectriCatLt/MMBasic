[>724] MATH(M_DETERMINANT array!()) 
Returns the determinant of the array. The array must be square. 

MMBasic supports a full range of functions to allow the manipulation of complex numbers. In this implementation complex numbers have a 32- bit real 
and 32-bit imaginary part and to make this work in MMBasic, it uses integers 
(64-bit) to hold these.
