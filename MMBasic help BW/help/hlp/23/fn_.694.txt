[>695] LINSTR(array%(), search$ [,start] [,size])) 
Returns the position of a search string in a long string. The returned value is an integer and will be zero if the substring cannot be found. 
'array%()' is the string to be searched and must be a long string variable. 
'search$' is the substring to look for and it must be a normal MMBasic string or expression (not a long string). The search is case sensitive. 
Normally the search will start at the first character in ' array%()' but the optional third parameter allows the start position of the search to be specified. 
If the optional parameter 'size' is specified the 'search$' is treated as a regular expression. 
See Appendix E for the details.
