[>698] LOF( [#]fnbr ) 
For a file on the SD card this will return the current length of the file in bytes. 
For a serial communications port opened as 'fnbr' this function will return the space (in characters) remaining in the transmit buffer. 
Note that when the buffer is full MMBasic will pause when adding a new character and wait for some space to become available. The # is optional.
