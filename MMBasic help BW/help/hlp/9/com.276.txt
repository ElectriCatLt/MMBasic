ALL VERSIONS
[>277] EDIT or  EDIT fname$ or EDIT FILE fname$ 
Invoke the full screen editor.
If a filename is specified the editor will load the file from the current disk (A: or B:) to allow editing and on exit with F1 or F2 save it to the disk. 
If the file does not exist it is created on exit. The current program stored in flash memory is not affected. 
If editing an existing file a backup with .bak appended to the filename is also created on exit. If  fname$ includes an extension other than .bas then colour coding will be temporarily turned off during the edit. 
If no extension is specified the firmware will assume .bas 
Editing a file from disk allows non-Basic files such as html or sprite files to be edited without corruption during the tokenising process that happens when stored to flash. 
EDIT and EDIT fname$ can only be invoked at the command prompt. However, it you require to edit a file in a program you can use the EDIT FILE fname$ command. 
This differs from EDIT fname$ in that it does not clear any variables and can only use any free memory for the edit buffer. 
This will place greater limits on the size of the file that can be edited if the memory usage of the calling program is itself large. 
See Full Screen Editor for details of how to use the editor.
