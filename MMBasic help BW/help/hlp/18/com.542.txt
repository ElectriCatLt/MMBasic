[>543] RTC SETREG reg, value or RTC GETREG reg, var 
RTC SETREG reg, value  
RTC GETREG reg, var 
The RTC SETREG and GETREG commands can be used to set or read the contents of registers within the chip. 
'reg' is the register's number, 
'value' is the number to store in the register and 
'var' is a variable that will receive the number read from the register. 
These commands are not necessary for normal operation but they can be used to manipulate special features of the chip (alarms, output signals, etc). 
They are also useful for storing temporary information in the chip's battery backed RAM. 
These chips are I2C devices and must be connected to the two I2C pins as specified by OPTION SYSTEM I2C with appropriate pullup resistors. 
Also see the command OPTION RTC AUTO ENABLE.
