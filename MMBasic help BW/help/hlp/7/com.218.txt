NOT VGA OR HDMI
[>219] CAMERA CAPTURE [scale, [x , y]]
This captures a picture from the camera (RGB565) and displays it on an LCD screen. An SPI LCD must be connected and enabled in order for the command to work. 
(ILI9341 and ST7789_320 recommended). Scale defaults to 1 and x,y each to 0 By default a 160x120 image is output on the LCD with the top left at 0,0 on the LCD. 
Setting scale to 2 will fill a 320x240 display with the image. Setting the x and y parameters will offset the top left of the image on the LCD. 
Update rate in a continuous loop is 7FPS onto the display at 1:1 scale and 5FPS scaled to 320x240. 
Assuming the display has MISO wired it is then possible to save the image to disk using the SAVE IMAGE command as used to create the example image above.
