ALL VERSIONS
[>237] CONTINUE 
Resume running a program that has been stopped by an END statement, an error, or CTRL-C. 
The program will restart with the next statement following the previous stopping point. 
Note that it is not always possible to resume the program correctly - this particularly applies to complex programs with graphics, nested loops and/or nested subroutines and functions.
