[>231] CMM2 LOAD or CMM2 RUN
Loads and or runs a program from disk using the CMM2 program loading mechanism. 
This includes an aggressive crunching of the program and supports #INCLUDE files and #DEFINE text replacement. 
This can be used for compatibility  with CMM2 programs or to allow structuring programs into separate modules. 
It is important to note that if used all editing of programs must be offline or direct to and from disk as the source files cannot be reconstructed from the version loaded by these commands.
