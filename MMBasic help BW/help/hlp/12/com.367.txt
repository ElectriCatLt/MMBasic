[>368] LIST PINS
Lists pins

This is actually quite a sneaky implementation. 
There is a CSUB command CallExecuteProgram which allows a CSUB to call a Basic subroutine in the user's program. 
It`s embedded  Basic implementation of the sub FREEPINS into the firmware completely transparently. 
When you call LIST PINS you are actually running a little Basic program but you don't see it and it doesn't use any user resource. 
AND the code is 100x simpler than doing the same thing in C
