[>375] LONGSTRING 
The LONGSTRING commands allow for the manipulation of strings longer than the normal MMBasic limit of 255 characters.
Variables for holding long strings must be defined as single dimensioned integer arrays with the number of elements set to the number of characters 
required for the maximum string length divided by eight. The reason for dividing by eight is that each integer in an MMBasic array occupies eight bytes. 
Note that the long string routines do not check for overflow in the length of the strings. 

If an attempt is made to create a string longer than a long string variable's size the outcome will be undefined.
