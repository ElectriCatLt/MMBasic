ALL VERSIONS
[>366] LIST [fname$] or LIST ALL [fname$] 
List a program on the console. LIST on its own will list the program with a pause at every screen full. 
LIST ALL will list the program without pauses. 
This is useful if you wish to transfer the program to a terminal emulator on a PC that has the ability to capture its input stream to a file. 
If the optional 'fname$' is specified then that file on the SD card will be listed.
