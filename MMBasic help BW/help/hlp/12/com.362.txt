ALL VERSIONS
[>363] LINE INPUT [prompt$,] string-variable$ 
Reads an entire line from the console input into 'string-variable$'.  
'prompt$' is a string constant (not a variable or expression) and if specified it will be printed first. 
Unlike INPUT, this command will read a whole line, not stopping for comma delimited data items. 
A question mark is not printed unless it is part of 'prompt$'.
