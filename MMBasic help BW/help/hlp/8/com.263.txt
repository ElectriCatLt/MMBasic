[>264] DRAW3D RESET n [,n1 [,n2...]}
This command takes the current rotated version of the object(s) and copies it into the initialisation data. 
Whilst this isn't recommended for iterative rotations it is very useful in establishing multiple views of the same object. 
Later in this document I will show how to use DRAW3D RESET to create and simultaneously manipulate front and plan views of identical objects
