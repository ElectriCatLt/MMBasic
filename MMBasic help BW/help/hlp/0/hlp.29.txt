[>30] A Tutorial - COMMAND PROMPT
Interaction with MMBasic is done via the console at the command prompt (ie, the greater than symbol (>) on the console). 
On startup MMBasic will issue the command prompt and wait for some command to be entered. 
It will also return to the command prompt if your program ends or if it generated an error message.
When the command prompt is displayed you have a wide range of commands that you can enter and execute. 
Typically they would list the program held in memory (LIST) or edit it (EDIT) or perhaps set some options (the OPTION command). 
Most times the command is just RUN which instructs MMBasic to run the program held in program memory.
Almost any command can be entered at the command prompt and this is often used to test a command to see how it works. 
A simple example is the PRINT command (more on this later), which you can test by entering the following at the command prompt:
PRINT 2 + 2
and not surprisingly MMBasic will print out the number 4 before returning to the command prompt.
This ability to test a command at the command prompt is useful when you are learning to program in BASIC, 
so it would be worthwhile having a Raspberry Pi Pico loaded with the PicoMite firmware handy for the occasional test while you are working through this tutorial.
