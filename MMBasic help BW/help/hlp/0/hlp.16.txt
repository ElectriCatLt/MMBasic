[>17] Special Characters in Strings
Special, non-printable characters can be inserted in string constants using the backslash (ie, \) as an escape symbol. 
To enable this facility the command OPTION ESCAPE must be placed at the start of the program. 
These are the valid escape sequences:
    Hex Value   Description

\a      07          Alert (Beep, Bell)
\b      08          Backspace
\e      1B          Escape character
\f      0C          Formfeed Page Break
\n      0A          Newline (Line Feed)
\r      0D          Carriage Return
\q      22          Quote symbol
\t      09          Horizontal Tab
\v      0B          Vertical Tab
\\      5C          Backslash
\nnn    any         The byte whose value is given 
                    by nnn interpreted as a decimal number
\&hh    any         The byte whose value is given by hh... 
                    interpreted as a hexadecimal number 

For example, the following will print the words Hello and World on separate lines:
OPTION ESCAPE
PRINT "Hello\r\nWorld"
