[>11] Program Initialisation
The library can also include code that is not contained within a subroutine or function. 
This code (if it exists) will be run automatically before a program starts running (ie, via the RUN command). 
This feature can be used to initialise constants or setup MMBasic in some way. 
For example, if you wanted to set some constants you could include the following lines in the library code:
CONST TRUE = 1
CONST FALSE = 0
For all intents and purposes, the identifiers TRUE and FALSE have been added to the language and will be available to any program that is run.
