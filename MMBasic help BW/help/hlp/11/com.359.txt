ALL VERSIONS
[>360] LINE x1, y1, x2, y2 [, LW [, C]] 
On the VGA monitor this command will draw a line starting at the coordinates 'x1' and 'y1' and ending at 'x2' and 'y2'. 
'LW' is the line's width and is only valid for horizontal or vertical lines. It defaults to 1 if not specified or if the line is a diagonal. 
'C' is an integer representing the colour and defaults to the current foreground colour. 
All parameters can be expressed as arrays and the software will plot the number of lines as determined by the dimensions of the smallest array. 
'x1', 'y1', 'x2', and 'y2' must all be arrays or all be single variables /constants otherwise an error will be generated. 
'lw' and 'c' can be either arrays or single variables/constants.
