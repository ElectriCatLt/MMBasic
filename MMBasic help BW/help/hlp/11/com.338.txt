ALL VERSIONS
[>339] HUMID pin, tvar, hvar [,DHT11]
Returns the temperature and humidity using the DHT22 sensor. Alternative versions of the DHT22 are the AM2303 or the RHT03 (all are compatible). 
'pin' is the I/O pin connected to the sensor. Any I/O pin may be used. 
'tvar' is the variable that will hold the measured temperature and 
'hvar' is the same for humidity. 
Both must be present and both must be floating point variables. For example: HUMID 3, TEMP!, HUMIDITY! 
Temperature is measured in C degree and the humidity is percent relative humidity. 
Both will be measured with a resolution of 0.1. If an error occurs (sensor not connected or corrupt signal) both values will be 1000.0. 
Normally the DHT22 should powered by 3.3V to keep its output below 3.6V for the Raspberry Pi Pico (the Pico 2 does not have this issue) 
and the signal pin of should be pulled up by a 1K to 10K resistor (4.7K recommended) to 3.3V. The optional DHT11 parameter modifies the timings to work with the DHT11. 
Set to 1 for DHT11 and 0 or omit for DHT22.

The HUMID command will read the humidity and temperature from a DHT22 humidity/temperature sensor. 
This device is also sold as the RHT03 or AM2302 but all are compatible and can be purchased on eBay for under $5. The DHT11 sensor is also supported.
The DHT22 must be powered from 3.3V (or up to 5V with the Raspberry Pi Pico 2) and it should have a pullup resistor on the data line as shown. 
This is suitable for long cable runs (up to 20 meters) but for short runs the resistor can be omitted as the PicoMite firmware also provides an internal weak pullup.
To get the temperature or humidity you use the HUMID command with three arguments as follows:
HUMID pin, tVar, hVar [,DHT11]
Where 'pin' is the I/O pin to which the sensor is connected. The I/O pin will be automatically configured by MMBasic.
'tVar' is a floating point variable in which the temperature is returned and 'hVar' is a second variable for the humidity. 
The temperature is returned as degrees C with a resolution of one decimal place (eg, 23.4) and the humidity is returned as a percentage relative humidity (eg, 54.3).
If the optional DHT11 parameter is set to 1 then the command will use device timings suitable for that device.
In this case the results will be returned with a resolution of 1 degree and 1% humidity 
For example:
DIM FLOAT temp, humidity
HUMID GP15, temp, humidity
PRINT "The temperature is" temp " and the humidity is" humidity
