ALL VERSIONS
[>528] PWM channel, frequency,[dutyA][,dutyB][,phase][,defer]
There are 8 separate PWM frequencies available (channels 0 to 7) and up to 16 outputs with individually controlled duty cycle. 
You can output on either PWMnA or PWMnB or both for each channel - no restriction. 
Duty cycles arespecified as a percentage and you can use a negative value to invert the output (-100.0 <= duty <=100.0).
Minimum frequency = (cpuspeed + 1) / (2^24) Hz. 
Maximum speed is OPTION CPUSPEED/4. 

At very fast speeds the duty cycles will be increasingly limited. 
Phase is a parameter that causes the waveforms to be centred such that a wave form with a shorter duty cycle starts and ends equal times from a longer one.  
Use 1 to enable this mode and 0 (or omit) to run as normal 
The parameter 'deferredstart' when set to 1 configures the PWM channels as but does not start the output running. 
They can the be started using the PWM SYNC command. This can be used to avoid any undesirable startup artefacts 
The PWM command is also capable of driving servos as follows:
PWM 1,50,(position_as_a_percentage * 0.05 + 5)
